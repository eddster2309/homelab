# Homelab Infrastructure
This repos contains the code to deploy my overly complex homelab. It is build on top of Proxmox and a few bare metai nodes for kubernetes. Everything is managed by Ansible, Terraform, Flux and Packer.

This repo is a public version of my homelab code with some components removed and/or replaced to not display the exact configuration of my homelab. Due to this, the code in this repository will not run or deploy correctly (also it will also always have a single commit).
